## Surface
   
### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The two main colours used are a shade of dark blue and white.
-   #### Typography
    -   The XXXXX font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
-   #### Imagery
    -   Each page will have a large hero image of spectacular landscapes of the destinations being sold, to act as a selling tool to the user. Images will also be used as backgrounds in certain sections, and there will additionally be a photo gallery for each tour page to further inspire the user to want to travel.
