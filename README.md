## Surface
   
### Design
-   #### Colour Scheme
    -   The two main colours used are a shade of dark blue, #030a4a, and a beige/offwhite colour, #F5F5DC. Many of the background images used throughout the site also aims to include these colours.
-   #### Typography
    -   The Raleway font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Raleway is an elegant font, frequently used for high-end websites and so was chosen to reflect the quality of the trips sold.
-   #### Imagery
    -   Each page will have a large hero image of spectacular landscapes of the destinations being sold, to act as a selling tool to the user. Images will also be used as backgrounds in certain sections, and there will additionally be a photo gallery for each tour page to further inspire the user to want to travel. Also, all photos were put through [Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) to reduce the file size and improve loading time.
-   #### Icons
    -   Social media icons and on the tour page have been used from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

# Accessibility

## Alt Tags

In order to ensure that all images are accessible for those using a screen reader, I have ensured that the large number of images used throughout the site include alt tags.

## Forms

The forms on the site used in the modals of "Contact Us" and "Enquire Now" have aria-labels so that screen readers can read out what is the required input in the necessary fields.

| Enquiry and contact modals not working on all pages   | Amended the Bootstrap data-target |
| Text overlapping on About Page history section    | Amended the padding for mobile devices only |
| H1 headings on hero images not central on all devices | Amended padding for best fit using media queries |
| Text on itinerary section not easily readable over background image   | Added a white background color with opacity value of 0.8  |
